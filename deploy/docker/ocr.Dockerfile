# Worker image for the two page/field OCR consumers (page_detection,
# standard_form_extraction). Built off the `[ocr]` extras group only
# (paddleocr + paddlepaddle, CPU) -- not the full `[ml]` group, which also
# pulls in torch/transformers for LayoutLMv3/Table Transformer that these
# two workers never import. Keeps this image's build time and size down
# until those later-phase workers get their own image.

# libgl1/libsm6/libxext6: paddleocr/paddlex pull in full `opencv-contrib-
# python` (not the `-headless` variant this project depends on directly),
# which dlopens libGL/libSM/libXext at import time even though nothing
# here ever opens a display.
